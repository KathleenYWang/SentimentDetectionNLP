# Sentiment Detection Using NLP

In this repo, we explore models to detect sentiment from texts.  
We explored two models in detail, the Bert model and a Hierarchical attention model.

## Data
The data we looked at were the Twitter Sentiment, Enron email data and WikiPedia Comment data. First four can be obtained from Kaggle.
